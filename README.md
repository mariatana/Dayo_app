 Dayo_app
 Combining three different technologies, our app, Dayo, is an effective way to solve one's mental health by putting a smile on his face. The first technology, the daily reasons and activities, are meant to motivate people to create a better life for themselves, both physically and mentally. The chatbot provides great information in getting knowledge about mental health issues and being of help as a confidential friend to a user who is feeling down, showing the beauty of life. Finally, the breathing exercise is effective in relaxing people who are suffering from panic attacks caused by the everyday life's burdens.
